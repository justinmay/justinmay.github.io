        I left off the previous blog with a set of goals: 
        <ol>
          <li>Get proficient at web design</li>
          <li>Improve my writing</li>
          <li>Note important ideas I come across</li>
          <li>Highlight projects I undertake</li>
          <li>Record my life</li>
        </ol>
        I have a hypothesis that the following design process will lead to better outcomes: define goals, outline a plan of action, break said actions into discrete steps, follow said steps in a consistent fashion, reflect and improve in a consistent fashion, reduce friction to take said steps, track improvement, meditate on said action, and profit. This idea seems incredibly trivial and self explanatory, but my insight is this: my whole life I have been — in my cohort of friends — incredibly medicore (It's actually incredible how medicore, if you controlled for factors such as varying socio-economic backgrounds, different teachers, access to specalized educations such as Music, Sports, etc. my GPA, success in sports, school rankings, etc. I am amazingly average.) This is not to say, though, that I am neither deeply unhappy, unsatisified, nor regretful for these experiences. This is rather, a reflection on my imperfect proces of learning. 

        The process of iterative learning, reflection, and improvement (known to some as "deliberate practice" or "perfect practice makes perfect") was first verbalized to me in an incredible book called "Grit: The Power of Passiona and Perseverance," by Angela Duckworth. If you haven't heard of it, here's an incredible <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-ONEAcBeTk">Google talk</a>. If anything, my biggest takeaway is the following two equations: 

        <div>
          Talent x Effort = Skill
          Skill x Effort = ACHIEVEMENT
        </div>

        and in the pursuit of doing simple algebra to seem smart: 

        <div>
          Talent X Effort^2 = ACHIEVEMENT 
        </div>

        Then, for no real purpose, the "runtime" of Achievement (holding talent as a constant) is O(effort^2). I have always found it helpful to frame abstract concepts with relateable ideas. 

        The "Theme" or henceforth new years resolution I have for 2019 is meaningful effort or grit. A gritty year. Year of Grit. Whatever that may be, it should inform my every decision (and hopefully develop as a skill).  

        I will leave off this blog post with a plan of action for each goal: 
        <ol>
          <li>Get proficient at web design</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Redesign my personal website in Angular </li>
            <li>(Execiting project I'm not sure I can reveal for legal reasons)</li>
          </ol>
          <li>Improve my writing</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Write minimum one blog post per month</li>
            <li>Read minimum ten blog posts per month</li>
            <li>Ask one new person per month to review my writing</li>
          </ol>
          <li>Note important ideas I come across</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Highlight at least one important talk/ concept/ book/ blog etc. per blog</li>
            <li>Research and explore these ideas more before each blog to dive into them deeper</li>
          </ol>
          <li>Highlight projects I undertake</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Post updates on major projects I'm undertaking</li>
            <li>Post solutions to hard problems I tackle</li>
            <li>List all my major projects to come</li>
          </ol>
          <li>Record my life</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Create a flexible weekly schedule to keep</li>
            <li>Record meaningful progress and insights</li>
          </ol>
        </ol>

        Indulge me for a moment and let us posit the nature of blogs. It seems to me that a good number of succesful people submit themselves to this gruling task. I find it incredibly uncomfortable, sitting alone with my own thoughts. My insecurities seep front and center: if I am being honest, I wonder if I have anything worth saying, if I will be judged by the content of my words and the values that I present. But, I suppose, if a good number of successfull, well-to-do, self made individuals keep blogs (Paul Gram, Tim Ferris, and Joel Spolsky to name a few) there must be some measurable benefit. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So, as I struggle with some difficult life choices and an impending feeling <strike>of doom</strike> that I am at a major cross-roads, I figured there is no better time to start. I'm beginning this blog for a few reasons. 
        <ol>
          <li>Get proficient at web design</li>
          <li>Improve my writing</li>
          <li>Note important ideas I come across</li>
          <li>Highlight projects I undertake</li>
          <li>Record my life</li>
        </ol>
        I hope that, by the end of this blog I will have experimented with Angular, React, and learned about the wonderfully intimidating world of front end web-development. Hopefully, I won't be copy-pasting W3schools templates one year from now. I hope that when I finish this blog, beautiful proes will flow from the tips of my fingers (as the late President George H. W. Busch was affectionatly known, Mangler of the English language. Read Jon Meacham's beautiful <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/in-funeral-of-pomp-and-pageantry-nation-bids-farewell-to-george-bush/ar-BBQxMBP">eulogy here</a>) I hope by the end of this blog, I will have shared some truly novel and insightful ideas, that you the reader, will have become a more well rounded person. Most of all, I hope that I will have highlighted the honest struggles of an average asian-american from a large state school attempting to change the world.

        It would be remiss of me not to describe my incredibly pretentious title. The Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon is, in plain english, the phenomenon for a mundane, uncommon, or otherwise unnoteworthy thing to pop up over and over once you have noticed it. Over the past few months, I have encountered many small, personable, insprining, and impressive blogs that have inspried me to start my own.
